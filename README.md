# HTML, CSS, Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This repository was created to practice my HTML, CSS, and Git skills with a code refactoring task. I took the starter code and made it more accessible following a list of specific criteria.

As a result, I consolidated CSS selectors and properties, organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each element or section of the page.

## Authors and acknowledgment

I would like to express my gratitude to the team at the EdX Front-end Development Bootcamp for providing me with this code refactoring challenge and the starter code to work with.
